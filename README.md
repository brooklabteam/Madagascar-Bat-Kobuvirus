# Madagascar Bat Kobuvirus

This repository contains data and pipelines necessary to create the figures for the Madagascar bat kobuvirus paper [link]()

Sub-directories within this repo contain pipeline directions and are split as such:

- Pipelines directory: Contains necessary code and raw input data to curate results
- Results directory: Contains necessary results to create figures
- Figures directory: Contains R code needed to create the final versions of the figures for the paper 

This workflow broadly followed the Brook lab's [Mada-Bat-CoV pipeline](https://github.com/brooklabteam/Mada-Bat-CoV)
